# 19.1.6

Went to the Dev tools and learned how we can go to the Network tab to adjust the internet speed. In the spot up top where it says no throttling we instead select Slow 3g.
First Meangful paint is gone a we should use Largest Contentiful Paint instead.

# 19.1.7

We used https://javascript-minifier.com/ to reduce the white space in our code.  We used https://imagecompressor.com/ to reduce the image size of 6 of our jpg images.  Finally we added defer

<script src='assets/js/vendor/jQuery.js' defer ></script>
<script src='assets/js/vendor/bootstrap.js' defer ></script>
<script src='./dist/script.min.js' defer ></script>

to lazy load our js files to only be used when needed.
